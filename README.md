National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Challenge Project (NCP) provides students with the opportunity to apply their knowledge, skills, and abilities to a realistic hands-on scenario similar to what would be expected of them in actual cybersecurity work roles. It also describes use cases, lessons learned, and the future focus of the project.
